# ECS-Snowplowing-Project

The snowplow program simulates a snowplow robot that plows snowy roads in a network by priortizing clearing snowy roads over travelling down roads that are already cleared. The network is created with a simple undirected graph.

The data plotting program simulates 10,000 trials and plots the average time of the robot and number of times it travels down a road that is already cleared.
